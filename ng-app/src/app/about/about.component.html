<p>This project was about the relationships between data. If I had used a SQL database, to find actors who had been in at least one title together, I would do something like:</p>
<pre>SELECT actors.name, actors.id
FROM actors JOIN actor_image ON actor.id = actor_image.actor_id
WHERE actor_image.image_id IN
(select image_id from actor_image where actor_image.actor_id = 7782)
AND actors.id <> 7782</pre>

<p>Or do the equivalent with an ORM. And that only returns pairs</p>

But since relationships were just as important as the data, I chose a graph database—neo4j. The graph database handles the relationships between multiple people as well. Multi-join queries won't be necessary. The above query would be a simple
<pre>MATCH (a:Actor)-[:acted_in]->(b:Title)<-[:acted_in]-(c:Actor)
WHERE a.id = 7782
RETURN c.name, c.id</pre>

<p>I used an OGM—py2neo—and wrote my own queries when they got too complex. However, since that functionality wasn't available, I had to extend it</p>
